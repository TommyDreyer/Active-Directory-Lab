# Active Directory Lab

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a virtual lab environment that has a server hosting splunk, a Windows Server machine that has Active Directory and is a Domain Controller, as well as a target machine and an attacking machine. From there, my objective was to see what I could do to generate telemetry that can then be viewed on Splunk.
